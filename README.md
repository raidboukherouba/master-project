# 1.Arabic Sentiment Analysis Web App

A React-based web application for analyzing sentiment in Arabic text using various machine learning models, including traditional classifiers, deep learning models, and ensemble methods (All models were fine-tuned by me as part of this project.).

## 2.Features

- **Multiple Model Support**:
  - Traditional ML: SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes
  - Deep Learning: CNN, LSTM
  - Transformer Models: Arabic BERT (Base/Mini/Medium), DistilBERT, araGPT2
  - Ensemble Methods: Majority Voting, Stacking

- **Real-time Analysis**:
  - Get sentiment predictions (Positive/Negative) with confidence scores
  - Visualize results with progress bars and color-coded indicators

- **Detailed Insights**:
  - For ensemble models, view contributions from each sub-model
  - Compare probability distributions for different models
